# Unix Domain Socket C++ Example
This simple example covers a basic usage of Unix domain socket as well as pthread/signal written in C++.

# Why this?
Integrating pthread and signal into C++ class/member functions are not so intuitive. Hope this example can help c++ novices pick up minimal knowledge they need to know before writing unix domain socket applications.
